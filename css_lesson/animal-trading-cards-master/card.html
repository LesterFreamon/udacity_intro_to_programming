        <p>Space dogs are a sub-breed of the Australian Shepherd and are identical to them in virtually every way. For
            that reason some scientists classify them as the same breed. The only apparent difference is the Space Dog's
            tendency to get their head stuck in the trash can. In fact, that is where their name comes from, as the bin
            resembles an astronaut helmet.</p>
